    * var_depths.py Python script defining the function var_depths, that computes the variance of the leaves' depths of
    a given tree; min_var_depths_vector, that returns the tuple formed by the minimal variance of a given number of
    leavesand the vector of l_i's;     and min_var_depths, that returns the tuple formed by the minimal variance of a
    given and ONE tree that attains it.
